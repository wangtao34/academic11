    Research Description:
    * Constructing a gait video database of depressive patients and healthy people in a natural state
    * Exploring the abnormal gait characteristics associated with depression
    * Establishing a standardized gait feature model for describing the difference between a depressed patient and a healthy person
    * Technology includes information theory, pattern recognition, machine learning, Python and OpenCV

    Research Description:
    * A novel gait assessment framework was proposed to implement non-intrusive, real-time and automatic depression detection using Kinect
    * Built innovatively a pseudo-velocity model to analyze the gait abnormalities of patients with depression, and explored the gait spatial information for skeleton-based recognition tasks using deep learning based on Riemannian manifolds
    * Research on feature extraction and recognition classification algorithms of EEG signals, and classification of specific emotions of military soldiers on specific occasions
    * Participate in the collection of a variety of biological signals and development of acquisition equipment. I master Keil Vision5, Altium Designer, Solidworks and have STM32 and FPGA usage experience;
